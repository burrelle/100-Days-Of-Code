# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactor JavaScript 30 repository to include ESLint, Husky, and Jest for increased code quality.

**Thoughts**: While the setup can be trivial, testing vanilla JavaScript with Jest can be interesting. Adding tools like Husky for pre-commit and pre-push checks, ESLint for code rules as well as Jest for testing produces higher quality code.
