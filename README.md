# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactor JavaScript 30 repository to include ESLint, Husky, and Jest for increased code quality.

**Thoughts**: While the setup can be trivial, testing vanilla JavaScript with Jest can be interesting. Adding tools like Husky for pre-commit and pre-push checks, ESLint for code rules as well as Jest for testing produces higher quality code.

**Today's Progress**: Apply the concept of "Array Cardio" in both JavaScript and PHP.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the JavaScript 30 course by working on Flexbox and applying classes through vanilla JavaScript. Started working through Gophercises to familiarize myself with Golang. Started working through the Echo Framework (Go).

**Thoughts**: Working through practical examples are the way that I learn how to do things. Working on Gophercises as well as working on the Echo framework for building web applications with Go is a great way to sharpen fundamentals.

### Day 4: January 4th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the JavaScript 30 challenge. Refactored the Echo API with the addition of SQLite and GORM. Added integration testing and scaffolding of frontend.

**Thoughts**: GORM made the application cleaner and made it possible to migrate to something like MySQL or Postgres as it moves closer to deployment. Took the opportunity to run the tests with Jest and Supertest.
