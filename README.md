# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactor JavaScript 30 repository to include ESLint, Husky, and Jest for increased code quality.

**Thoughts**: While the setup can be trivial, testing vanilla JavaScript with Jest can be interesting. Adding tools like Husky for pre-commit and pre-push checks, ESLint for code rules as well as Jest for testing produces higher quality code.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the JavaScript 30 course by working on Flexbox and applying classes through vanilla JavaScript. Started working through Gophercises to familiarize myself with Golang. Started working through the Echo Framework (Go).

**Thoughts**: Working through practical examples are the way that I learn how to do things. Working on Gophercises as well as working on the Echo framework for builing web applications with Go is a great way to sharpen fundementals.
